====

Brew is an open source library of interface components for ASP.NET which utilizes jQuery and jQuery UI.

If Brew looks familiar, that's for good reason. Brew is a heavily refactored fork of the Juice UI project.

## What makes Brew different

Creating a project that's just a copy of another would be silly. Brew stands out in a few ways from it's cousin.

* Brew uses an unobtrusive, but speedy means to render widgets. That means no more huge blocks of javascript in the rendered page, and Brew doesn't litter your tags with extra attributes.
* Brew's unobtrusive javascript runs quickly and is far less complex.
* Brew's extenders and controls are simpler and more intuitive to use. 
* Brew's codebase is much smaller, making it easier to maintain and fix bugs faster.
* Brew is a spartan release, no extra fluff or unnecessary extras.
* Brew contains all of the as-yet unreleased bug fixes from the JuiceUI master repository.

* Community interaction - This is a big one. If an issue, problem, pull request, etc. gets posted here, it's going to get looked into.

## Boring Stuff

**Why create Brew?**

I had the pleasure to work on the original Juice UI project (check out the commit history) and while it was a great project, it was always limited in some aspects. 
Brew will enjoy a fast and frequent release cycle. Brew is also a different direction for it's cousin project, and everything that I had wanted to do with Juice. It's a significant departure and is unbound by the restrictions of it's cousin. 

**System Requirements**

Brew requires the .NET Framework v4.5. You can download it here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653
There are no plans to include support for earlier versions of .NET, that includes Sharepoint limitations.

**Licensing**

Unless otherwise stated, the code here is licensed under the MIT license. Have at it!
